Steven, Nico:

   - static explorer (running once) for types?
   - probably need to invalidate cache: installing package causes
      new list of installed packages
   - optimise using parallel builds?
   - consens: test on 2 test server

Test servers:

   - create one new ssh-keypair to be deployed on both machines
   - create rsync script to copy who repo to test machines
   - write benchmark script, that runs from 1:n hosts and records
      - cpu time
      - real time
