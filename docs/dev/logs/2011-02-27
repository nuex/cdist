Cdist installation / configuring / types
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

problems:
   - types are not in /etc/cdist/type by default
   - types should be updatable
   - cdist should be easily updateable
   - make configuration version control able easily

solution:
   - require a special user ("cdist")
   - always git clone from specific branch
      - better version-1.0 or 1.0 or similar
   - conf/manifests mv example?
   - upstream types get updated
