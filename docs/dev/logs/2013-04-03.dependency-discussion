Discussion raised due to proposal from Arkaitz Jimenez

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal changes back to cdist behaviour as of 2011 (see commit 61b7b68).

Change would introduce:

- no direct stage based running
- stages only in object (not globally)
- cannot build full dependency list before beginning
    - Thus wildcard requirements (require="__file/*") don't work anymore

Accepting this or similar approaches means:

- Drop wildcard requirements (is undocumented anyway)
- Type execution is closed (again)

Furthermore/other points:

- Change cdist to continue run as long as possible
    - Don't stop if an object fails
    - Record failure, print at the end (and exit non zero)

- Logging
    - Catch output of manifest, gencode, code, do not display directly
    - Print at the end
    - Prefix with hostname as usual!
