require="__broken_type/foo" breaks too late

- always catch OSError/IOError: (check all occurences)
- type __director does not exist, abort in emulator
   - if called type is not existing
   - if required type is not existing
- type constructor fails if type does not exist
- test type emulator with non existent types -> should raise NoSuchTypeError
