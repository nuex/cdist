A type __get_and_build:
   requires __directory /var/tmp
   wget's source to /var/tmp
   builds programm in /var/tmp

   Question: How to define that this object depends on
      __directory/var/tmp?

   Answer for now:
      require="__directory/var/tmp" $__self "$@"
         -> construct $@ from params in directory

   Answer2 for now:
      Use a second type:
         __get_and_build:
            __directory /var/tmp
            require="__directory/var/tmp" __build
         __build:
            gencode-remote:
               wget && build


   Answert for soon:
      Should be doable easier!
