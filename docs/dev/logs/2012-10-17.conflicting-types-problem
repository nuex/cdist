Problem source:

__directory/var/named explorer detects that the directory is missing
__package/named gencode-remote installs package, which creates directory
__directory/var/named gencode-remote outputs mkdir

Solutions:

    - don't use __directory, because __package does already the job (clean solution)
    - re-run explorer before gencode-* stage
        - gencode-remote would have caught that

Not sure yet - although the latter feature has been requested, the first
solution looks better (more clean) to this problem.
